this assignment was to create a program that fetches data from a local json file and display on 2 graphs 
one of which was a pie graph the other I chose a bar graph for.

the program accomplishes this using html canvas and for each loops.
the data was fetched and passed to 2 function each containg a loop that calles specific
items from the json file specifically the colour title and flavour values and using this
information to plot the graphs the titles to label the points on the graphs and the flavour to 
create the percentage valuesfor each plotted point.
